# ============================================================
# Streamlit Theme Configuration
#
# In this project, I created a custom Streamlit theme to ensure
# the user interface is clean, readable, and consistent across
# different machines. By default, Streamlit may render in a dark
# theme depending on the environment, which caused navy backgrounds
# and readability issues.
#
# To avoid that, I explicitly force a light theme and define
# all major color values here.
#
# This improves:
# - Visual clarity
# - Accessibility (contrast)
# - UI consistency
# - Professional presentation

[theme]

# I explicitly set the base theme to light so Streamlit does not
# default to its dark navy theme.
base="light"


# This is the primary accent color used throughout the app.
# It affects buttons, sliders, highlights, and interactive elements.
# I selected a bright green to make the UI feel friendly and modern.
primaryColor="#22C55E"


# This controls the main background color of the entire application.
# I use pure white to maximize readability and keep the interface clean.
backgroundColor="#FFFFFF"


# This sets the background color for secondary areas such as:
# - The sidebar
# - Expanders
# - Containers
# I chose a very light gray-blue to create subtle visual separation
# without introducing dark tones.
secondaryBackgroundColor="#F1F5F9"


# This sets the default text color across the app.
# I selected a dark navy tone to maintain strong contrast against white.
# Good contrast is important for accessibility and readability.
textColor="#0F172A"


# This sets the global font family.
# I use a sans-serif font because it is standard for modern UI design
# and improves screen readability.
font="sans serif"
