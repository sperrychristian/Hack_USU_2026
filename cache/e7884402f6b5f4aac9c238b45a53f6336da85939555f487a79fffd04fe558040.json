The closest he ever came was the Roger Mayer\nOctavia together with the Univox Uni-Vibe, and he turned to drugs to\nfill that empty spot in his soul from never having found that perfect\ntone.\n\nAnd Plato spent five years in a cave - it wasn't an allegory - together\nwith a family of chipmunks, trying to teach them to play the bagpipes in\norder to find true knowledge and understanding.  He too failed in his\nsearch for that perfect tone, and ended up giving up on electric guitar\nentirely.  Today known mainly for his philosophy, with few sources even\nmentioning his bloody hands from trying to sew tiny tiny bagpipes.\n\nWonder no more.\n\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>", "tree": {"sha": "698d3e1f95c810ebadbbb589db361b17b492e779", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/AudioNoise/git/trees/698d3e1f95c810ebadbbb589db361b17b492e779"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/AudioNoise/git/commits/6a6daef2f4d724f5f36a610f66db9644c0173771", "comment_count": 1, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null, "verified_at": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/AudioNoise/commits/6a6daef2f4d724f5f36a610f66db9644c0173771", "html_url": "https://github.com/torvalds/AudioNoise/commit/6a6daef2f4d724f5f36a610f66db9644c0173771", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/AudioNoise/commits/6a6daef2f4d724f5f36a610f66db9644c0173771/comments", "author": {"login": "torvalds", "id": 1024025, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQwMjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1024025?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds", "html_url": "https://github.com/torvalds", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "torvalds", "id": 1024025, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQwMjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1024025?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds", "html_url": "https://github.com/torvalds", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "3a6b51032da587e5d2e269515f3dc21c96da15c4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/AudioNoise/commits/3a6b51032da587e5d2e269515f3dc21c96da15c4", "html_url": "https://github.com/torvalds/AudioNoise/commit/3a6b51032da587e5d2e269515f3dc21c96da15c4"}]}, "_links": {"self": "https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/AudioNoise/branches/main", "html": "https://github.com/torvalds/AudioNoise/tree/main"}, "protected": false, "protection": {"enabled": false, "required_status_checks": {"enforcement_level": "off", "contexts": [], "checks": []}}, "protection_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/AudioNoise/branches/main/protection"}
